Git and Github are essential components for collaboration and will serve a central role in reproducible research.  This topic will briefly introduce you to the rationale for having a versioning system and guide you through registering a GitHub account, explore access tokens, and create a and manipulate a sample repository through RStudio.

## Student Learning Objectives

At the end of this topic, you should be able to:  
 - *Describe the basic rationale and need for a distributed versioning system.*  
 - *Create a new repository on GitHub.*  
 - *Check out, modify, commit, and push changes in RStudio back to GitHub.*
