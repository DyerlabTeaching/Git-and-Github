### Logistics & Registration

The following steps should get you to be configuring your github account properly.

1. Go to https://github.com and register as a user.  Your user name will be used publically, so choose one *appropriately*.  
2. Save your username and password in a secure location (password manager...).

In this section, we will use the web interface to create a new repository and then use RStudio to craft a new project from it, make changes, and then push it back to GitHub.

1. Log into your GitHub account.
2. Select "Repositories" from the menu and then create a New one with the following characteristics.
   - No Template
   - Pick a publically visible name for your first test repository and put it into the `Repository name` field.
   - Add a short description.
   - Make it `Public`
   - Add a `README` file.
   - For `.gitignore` select `R` as the language.
   - Explore a license (add one or not, it is up to you).
3. Create the repository.
